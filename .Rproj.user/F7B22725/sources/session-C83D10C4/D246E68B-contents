## Overview of workflow and components

The Web is written in **HTML**, for example:

``` {{default}}
<h2>Section heading</h2>
<p>Here is some paragraph text.</p>
<p>A bulleted list:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

In 2004, John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created **Markdown**:

``` {{default}}
## Section heading

Here is some paragraph text.

A bulleted list:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
```

[**Quarto**](https://quarto.org/) (previously RMarkdown) is an extension of Markdown which allows for chunks of R code, LaTeX for math, and lots of configurability. Headers are written in a format called [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/) (short for "YAML Ain't a Markup Language").

[**Pandoc**](https://pandoc.org/) is a document conversion tool which can accept and output many formats. The [{knitr}](http://yihui.org/knitr/) package uses Pandoc to convert your Quarto document into one or several desired output files.

We don't need to use Pandoc directly---we're simply going to write Quarto docs and click on RStudio's Render button. ![](images/paste-D4CB0351.png)

*Note:* if you want to produce PDFs, you may also need to install a TeX package such as [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/).

## What can you do with Quarto?

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
### Without code:

-   Prepare outputs of any non-interactive type
-   Rich hypertext, images, math LaTeX, footnotes
-   In-text citations and generated bibliography
-   Tables (manually entered)
-   Existing plots (if they were generated somewhere else; insert as image)
-   Configure via options in file headers
-   Visual editor suggested

### With code (R, Python):

-   Analysis (expressed as code + output)
-   Plots
-   Tables auto-created and/or heavily computed (using [knitr::kable](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html))
-   Interactive elements in webpages and presentations
-   Dashboards, web apps
:::

## Writing documents

-   Simple rich text (bold, italic, code), hyperlinks, headers, and blockquotes are available
    -   Headers are important! Quarto treats them as the structure of your document (think: introduction, methods, results, conclusion---but no need to limit yourself to these)
    -   Suggestion: use the visual editor toolbar rather than typing the syntax by hand in the Source editor.
-   LaTeX can be inserted inline, e.g.: $H =-\sum p_i \ln p_i$ or in display (block) mode
-   Images (SVG, PNG, JPG) can be inserted, scaled, and captioned. Add alt-text for accessibility.
-   When you're ready to convert your Quarto doc to a different format, check the `format` field in the header, then click Render.
-   Formats: Word (`docx`), `html`, `pdf` (via LaTeX), GitHub-flavored markdown (`gfm`)
-   See accompanying files `lorem-ipsum-paper.qmd`, `.html`, `.docx`, and `.pdf`
    -   Text source: [Lorem Ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/)
-   Docs reference: [Markdown Basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html), [Word Basics](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html)

## Presentation slides

-   Formats: Revealjs (browser-based, HTML), PowerPoint (pptx), Beamer (LaTeX PDF)
-   The Quarto source document looks the same, but each Heading2 becomes a slide title
-   The current presentation was created in Quarto using the `revealjs` format (default theme)
-   For Revealjs, important parameters are `scrollable`, `smaller` (change default font size), and `self-contained` (create a single HTML file including images)
-   See accompanying files `lorem-ipsum-pres.qmd`, `.html`, `.pptx`, and `.pdf`
-   Docs reference: [Presentations](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/)

## Websites and books

-   A project of related documents can be compiled into a website or book
-   Book formats: HTML, PDF, MS Word, EPUB
-   Book example: @grolemund2014
-   Since Quarto is still so new, most RMarkdown-authored books you'll find are made in the [{bookdown}](https://bookdown.org/) package. Some prominent examples:
    -   @theprac2018
    -   @silge2017
    -   @wilke2019
-   Another package to look at for HTML output is [{pagedown}](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown), which uses CSS styling to make a variety of formats (poster; CV; pdf-style paged document)

## Generating citations and bibliographies

-   In the Visual editor, go to Insert $\rightarrow$ Citation
    -   You can paste a DOI, or search CrossRef and DataCite records
    -   If you use Zotero, this dialog can also access your library
    -   Quarto generates the in-text citation for you, you only need to use a token like `@Bordelon2022c`
    -   Cited works are collected into a bib file, whose contents are turned into a bibliography at the end of your document
-   You can also bring your own BibTeX file
-   Docs reference: [Technical Writing: Citations](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html#citations), [Citations & Footnotes](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html)

## About code chunks

-   To insert a code chunk anywhere, press *Ctrl+Alt+I* (Windows) or *Cmd+Option+I* (macOS).
-   While working in RStudio, you can run the chunk (or a single line of the chunk) anytime
-   When you Render your doc, the usual behavior will be to run every chunk, show its code, and then the output of the code.
    -   Each of these is configurable (don't run chunk, suppress code, suppress output) per-chunk or for the whole doc
-   Additional languages supported in Quarto: Python, Julia, Observable
-   Docs reference: [Using R](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html), [Execution Options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html)

## Learning more

-   Browse the [docs](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) or [gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/)
-   Try making a Word document or slide deck
-   Once you're comfortable making documents and presentations, and assuming you're new to R, a next step could be to learn about data visualization with the ggplot2 package, with a goal towards plotting some of your own data (perhaps reproducing an existing plot).
