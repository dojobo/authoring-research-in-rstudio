## Overview of workflow and components

The Web is written in **HTML**, for example:

``` {{default}}
<h2>Section heading</h2>
<p>Here is some paragraph text.</p>
<p>A bulleted list:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

In 2004, John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created **Markdown**:

``` {{default}}
## Section heading

Here is some paragraph text.

A bulleted list:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
```

[**Quarto**](https://quarto.org/) (previously RMarkdown) is an extension of Markdown which allows for chunks of R code, LaTeX for math, and lots of configurability. Headers are written in a format called [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/) (short for "YAML Ain't a Markup Language").

[**Pandoc**](https://pandoc.org/) is a document conversion tool which can accept and output many formats. The [{knitr}](http://yihui.org/knitr/) package uses Pandoc to convert your Quarto document into one or several desired output files.

We don't need to use Pandoc directly---we're simply going to write Quarto docs and click on RStudio's Render button. ![](images/paste-D4CB0351.png)

*Note:* if you want to produce PDFs, you may also need to install a TeX package such as [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/).

## What can you do with Quarto?

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
### Without code:

-   Prepare outputs of any non-interactive type
-   Rich hypertext, images, math LaTeX
-   Tables (manually entered)
-   Plots (if they were generated somewhere else; insert as image)
-   Configure via options in file headers
-   Visual editor suggested

### With code (R, Python):

-   Analysis (expressed as code + output)
-   Plots
-   Tables auto-created and/or heavily computed (using [knitr::kable](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html))
-   Interactive elements in webpages and presentations
-   Dashboards, web apps
:::

## Writing documents

-   Simple rich text (bold, italic, code), hyperlinks, headers, and blockquotes are available
    -   Suggestion: use the visual editor toolbar rather than typing the syntax by hand in the Source editor.
-   LaTeX can be inserted inline: $H =-\sum p_i \ln p_i$ or in display (block) mode
-   Images (SVG, PNG, JPG) can be inserted, scaled, and captioned. Add alt-text for accessibility.
-   When you're ready to convert your Quarto doc to a different format, check the `format` field in the header, then click Render.
-   Formats: Word (`docx`), `html`, `pdf` (via LaTeX), GitHub-flavored markdown (`gfm`)
-   Docs reference: [Markdown Basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html), [Word Basics](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html)

## Presentation slides

-   Formats: Revealjs (browser-based, HTML), PowerPoint (pptx), Beamer (LaTeX PDF)
-   The Quarto source document looks the same, but each Heading2 becomes a slide title
-   For Revealjs, important parameters are `scrollable`, `smaller`, and `self-contained`
-   Docs reference: [Presentations](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/)

## Websites and books

\[@\]

## Citations and bibliographies

-   If you have a BiBTeX file: you can specify it in the header using the `bibliography` field
-   Docs reference: [Technical Writing](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html)
